Unlike other crops that grows from seeds, Cavendish banana farmer would plant the stems and brunches of existing banana trees to grow more bananas.  This makes all Cavendish bananas have the same genetic makeup, which is vulnerable to a fungus that is found spreading and killing orchards of bananas.  Cavendish banana could become extinct, which it what happened to previous commercial banana species.","(A) Cavendish.","(B) Gros Michel.","(C) Lack of genetic diversity","(B) They may become extinct.","Modern farming practices in banana orchards results in genetic uniformity for Cavendish bananas.  All Cavendish are vulnerable to a strain of fungus that causes Panama disease and kills the plant.  There is no genetic diversity to fight the fungus and Cavendish might go extinct if the spread of said fungus continues."

The old banana is sweeter and thicker. However, these banana extinguish by getting infected by virus. We only have one kind of banana Cavendish these days. This makes banana vulnerable to any gene mutuation disease. ","(A) Cavendish.","(B) Gros Michel.","(C) Lack of genetic diversity","(B) They may become extinct.","The main concern is Cavendish banana is going to extinguish due to weak of genetic disease just like the Gros Michel back in the old time. The genetic uniformity of the Cavendish banana making it hard to resist diseases and when they get infected, there are no other solution to tackle this problem. There is no other replacement to banana if Cavendish getting the disease and extinguish. There will be no banana after that happens. "
