One of the method utilizes genetic modification.  Only pregnant female mosquitoes' diet would require blood and therefore spread diseases when feeding.  So only males are used in the study. Lab-grown male A. Aegypti mosquitoes were released, expected to mate with the wild population.  Those males carries a gene that inhibits their offsprings maturing into adulthood.  In time, the population of wild A. Aegypti mosquitoes would decrease as a result."
