"2024/08/14 11:36:56 下午 GMT+8","P10","Cloud pattern is one of the factors regulating the earth's surface temperature.  When it is hot, more water evapourate into the air and forms more clouds, which block sunlight and lowers temperature.  When it is cold, vice versa.  Sea algae population is believed to be influencing and being regulated from this cycle.  When there is less cloud and temperature rises, algae could conduct photosynthesis and reproduce rapidly.  Where there is more cloud and temperature drops, algae population decline.  Water on the surface of sea would circulate with water on the bottom due to difference in temperature, bring nutrients from deeper level to the surface.  Weather predicting models are consistent when cloud is not considered.  When cloud pattern is included, results are not consistent.","(B) decrease global warming.","(D) Difficult prediction of regional climate impacts","(C) the models agreed quite well.","(C) Because there is uncertainty about the impact of clouds in climate models.","Since climate models without considering clouds shows consistent findings, while models including cloud shows inconsistence.  This indicates that cloud's effect on regional weather is not clear."
